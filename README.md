# Introduction to QFrameClient

## Overview

`QFrameClient` is a specialized Qt library designed for seamless communication with Samsung's The Frame, a range of lifestyle televisions that blend into your home environment like a piece of art. This library taps into the unique features of The Frame, enabling developers to create applications that can interact with these televisions in innovative ways.

## Key Features

- **Qt Integration**: Built on the robust Qt framework, `QFrameClient` leverages Qt's powerful features for cross-platform development, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration with existing Qt applications.

- **Samsung The Frame Compatibility**: Specifically tailored to communicate with Samsung The Frame TVs, the library provides a streamlined approach to sending commands, managing settings, and retrieving information from these devices.

- **Ease of Use**: With a focus on simplicity and usability, `QFrameClient` abstracts the complexities of direct device communication, offering a user-friendly API that developers can quickly incorporate into their applications.

- **Customization and Control**: The library opens up possibilities for customizing and controlling various aspects of The Frame, such as switching between TV and Art modes, updating artwork, and adjusting display settings.

## Applications

`QFrameClient` is ideal for developers looking to create custom solutions for environments where Samsung The Frame TVs are used. This includes:

- **Home Automation Systems**: Integrating The Frame into smart home solutions, allowing for automated control based on user preferences or environmental triggers.

- **Art Galleries and Exhibitions**: Enhancing the display of digital art, providing curators with the ability to remotely update and manage content shown on The Frame.

- **Commercial Spaces**: In retail or office settings, the library can be used to manage displays for advertising, information dissemination, or ambiance enhancement.

## Getting Started

Developers can easily incorporate `QFrameClient` into their Qt projects and start building applications that bring a new level of interaction to Samsung The Frame TVs.

### Using QFrameClient in QML:

In your C++ code, possibly in your `main()` function, include the following:

```cpp
QFrameClient::registerQml();
```

At the top of your QML file, add:

```qml
import qframeclient 1.0
```

You can use the `FrameClient` component in QML like this:

```qml
FrameClient {
    id: frameClient
    clientName: "FrameClient"       // A name used by The Frame to identify clients
    macAddress: "54:3A:D6:XX:XX:XX" // Optional, only used for the Wake-On-LAN feature
    ipAddress: "192.168.178.108"    // The IP address of your Frame-Device.
    connected: true
}
```

This setup allows you to integrate `QFrameClient` into your Qt project and use it in your QML code.
